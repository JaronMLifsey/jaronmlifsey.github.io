        <p>
			This editor allowed for the creation of multiple paths which enemies would take and for configuring which enemies would spawn on which path and at what time.
            The editor still needed some work before being really usable.
            For instance, there was no concept of waves yet which would make it a bit impractical to use to create longer missions.
        </p>
        <p>
			The editor's function was the creation of points which defined a path and moving those points in 3D space.
            They could be dragged freely and optionally snapped to the terrain height.
        </p>
        <p>
			The wave editor portion was a timeline which was split into a grid where rows designate different paths and each column represents a second.
            Each square could have any of the available enemy types assigned to it and any rectangular section could be selected, cut, copy, and pasted.
