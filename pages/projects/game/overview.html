        <p>
            I started on this project in college just after finishing my first programming class in Java.
            The idea was to create a tower defense game where towers consumed a limited resource from their surroundings to power their attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            It started as a 2D game written in Java, but after a while I decided to go 3D in C++ and DirectX.
            I researched engines but couldn't find one that fit my nonexistent budget and had a reasonable set of features.
            I considered Unity, but the free version didn't even support shadows which seemed too limiting to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I decided to try making my own.
            I read a DirectX 10 graphics programming book, quite a bit of Microsoft's documentation, and occasionally some online forums as I worked my way through the project.
            I used nothing but the DirectX API and the C++ standard libraries even to the point of implementing my own bitmap text rendering system and basic UI elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got decently far, thought still a ways off completion, but eventually gave up on the project as it proved more difficult than expected to create both an engine and a game and my college years were coming to an end.
            Unreal Engine 4 was also released with appealing terms for indie developers further solidifying the choice to stop trying to do that part myself.
